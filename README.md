# My very first website

### Welcome!   


#### My Project Links and Resources Page
This project is a comprehensive resource page with links and images related to various web technologies. It serves as a hub for quick access to essential tools and documentation.


#### Project Description
This webpage is designed to provide an easy-to-navigate list of links to important web technologies. The page includes references to HTML5, JavaScript, Cloud9, GitHub, Git, CSS3, MySQL, Heroku, Django, Python, MongoDB and Flask. Each link directs you to the corresponding Wikipedia page for more in-depth information.

#### Technologies Used
* HTML5: Structured the content of the webpage.
* CSS3: Styled the page, using Flexbox for layout and positioning of the images and links.
* Git: Used for version control, tracking changes, and managing the project.
* GitHub: Hosted the project, providing a platform for collaboration and sharing.
* Gitpod: An online IDE used for developing the project.

#### Rationale
The purpose of this project is to create a centralised resource for developers and non-developers alike. By providing direct links to key technologies, it helps streamline the learning process and serves as a reference for anyone looking to understand the building blocks of modern web development. 

This project aims to: 

* Offer a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
* Provide immediate access to educational resources.
* Enhance my understanding and practical use of HTML5 and CSS.
* Showcase my ability to create organized, useful, and visually appealing web pages.
